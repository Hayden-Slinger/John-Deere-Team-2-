## Intro
This Repository is built for my Capstone Project for the University of Iowa's Business Analytics & Information Systems. 


## Background
John Deere had manufacturing data from their Mannheim, Germany factory that was not being used by Quality Analyst. John Deere uses Smart Test for defect identification in the assembly process and collects data for analysis from Quality Engineers. I along with my team were tasked with cleaning, processing, and displaying our findings to the John Deere Data Team.
